#data-structures
In this sprint, my pair and I implemented and tested two basic data structures, Stack and Queue, in each of the four JavaScript instantiation styles: Functional, Functional shared, Prototypal and Pseudoclassical.

####Note
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
